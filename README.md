### Abstract

Web application for proving tautologies in set theory
The goal of this paper was to create a simple and intuitive tool for proving tautologies in set
theory. This was accomplished in a web application using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The basics of set theory, their relationship with logic, and methods for proving tautologies
were described. The way the application works, reverse polish notation, interesting code
fragments, and conclusions about the implementation are discussed.
